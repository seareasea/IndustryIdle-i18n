        "Industry Idle is a <em>resource management</em> game where you build factoriesüè≠, produce goodsüì¶ and make moneyüí∏.<br><br>Let's go through some basic concepts to get you started - it won't take long, I pinky promise.",
    Tutorial2:
        "All buildings need power‚ö°, you have a <em>wind turbine</em> that generates power. You can see your current power supply on the left side of the top bar.<br><br>You might have noticed that wind turbines only work <em>80%</em> of the time. You can consider building other types of power plants that generate stable power.",
    Tutorial3:
        "You have a lot of <em>resource deposits</em> on the map. To extract resources, you have to build mines‚õèÔ∏è <em>on top of</em> the corresponding deposit.<br><br>For example, you have an <em>oil wellüõ¢Ô∏è</em> that extracts <em>oil</em> from an oil deposit.<br></br>Resource deposits are unlimited - no need to worry about them running out. Apart from mines, other buildings can be built on any empty tile.",
    Tutorial4:
        "Resource transportation costs fuel. On this map, you can use <em>petrol‚õΩ</em> as fuel. You have an <em>oil refinery</em> that transports oil from the oil well and produces petrol.<br><br>The tiny moving <em>dots</em> represent the real-time movement of resources. You should optimize your building locations to minimize the distance of travel.<br><br><em>Upgrading</em> your buildings will increase their output, but will also increase their power usage and input required.<br><br>You can change your fuel type in the transportation centerüö¶. Remember to make sure your fuel production is above consumption otherwise your production will halt when you run out of fuel.",
    Tutorial5:
        "To make money, you need to export your resources via the trade center. To do this, simply turn on <em>auto sell</em> for that resource.<br></br>You can also buy resources from the trade center as well. Remember <em>if you buy a resource, you will drive up the price</em> and if you sell a resource, you will drive down the price.<br><br>The market is <em>volatile</em> and the priceüìà changes regularly.",
    Tutorial6:
        "To build new buildings, you need to unlock it first in the <em>research labüß™</em>. The research lab also converts science to research points.<br><br>Your wind turbine (and other power plants) produces a small amount of science when running. And you can build schoolüè´ and other dedicated buildings to boost science later.<br><br>Now you have learned all the basics, start to build up your economy! Here are some <em>cashüí∏</em> and <em>petrol‚õΩ</em> to give you a jump start.",
